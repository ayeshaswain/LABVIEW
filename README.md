# LABVIEW
LabVIEW is systems engineering software for applications that require test, measurement, and control with rapid access to hardware and data insights.
LabVIEW is relatively easy to get started with for a novice programmer. However mastering LabVIEW requires years of experience and dedication like mastering any other programming language. ... Such a level of mastering cannot be easily studied in courses or from books but requires hands-on real-world experience.
